# 1. Project Overview

## 1.1 Project Overview

In this project, I explored the transformative potential of Large Language Models (LLMs) and their applications across diverse industries. I developed a comprehensive understanding of LLMs by tracing their evolution from foundational concepts to advanced architectures, culminating in the creation of a functional chatbot for online shopping. This beginner-friendly initiative provided me with practical experience in leveraging LLMs to build knowledge-grounded applications, enhancing my skills in natural language processing and deep learning.

## 1.2 Objectives

My primary objective was to gain a thorough understanding of LLMs and apply this knowledge practically. I aimed to master fundamental concepts such as Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs), Transformer models, and attention mechanisms, while progressively tackling advanced techniques like prompt engineering, fine-tuning, and Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). The end goal was to design and implement an online shopping chatbot using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo, ensuring it delivers accurate and contextually relevant responses.

## 1.3 Technical Approach

### 1.3.1 Introduction to LLMs and Basics

I began by studying the basics of LLMs, including RNNs, Transformers, and attention mechanisms. I utilized illustrative examples to understand their use cases, such as text generation, establishing a solid foundation for further exploration.

### 1.3.2 Prompt Engineering

I implemented prompt engineering techniques, including zero-shot, one-shot, and few-shot inferences. Using the FLAN-T5 model, I applied these methods to a dialogue summarization task, enhancing my ability to craft effective prompts for desired outputs.

### 1.3.3 Fine-Tuning and Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT)

I performed both full fine-tuning and PEFT on a dialogue summarization task. I utilized methods like LoRA to optimize resource use and mitigate issues like catastrophic forgetting. To evaluate performance, I employed ROUGE metrics, ensuring the model’s effectiveness.

### 1.3.4 Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG)

I integrated RAG into the project using OpenAI’s GPT-3.5 Turbo, combining it with tools like LangChain and Streamlit. This approach enabled me to ground the chatbot’s knowledge in real-world data, reducing hallucinations and improving response accuracy.

### 1.3.5 Chatbot Development

I designed and built a functional chatbot for online shopping, following a step-by-step process. By leveraging RAG and the tech stack outlined below, I ensured the application provided personalized and reliable user interactions.

## 1.4 Tech Stack

I utilized the following technologies to execute this project:

- **Language**: Python 3.8
- **Libraries**: transformers, datasets, torchdata, torch, streamlit, openai, langchain, unstructured, sentence-transformers, chromadb, evaluate, rouge_score, loralib, peft
- **System Requirements**: I tested the code on a local system with 8GB RAM and an Intel Core i7 CPU, noting that a GPU could enhance training efficiency. Alternatively, I considered cloud platforms like Amazon EC2 for scalability.

## 1.5 Key Learnings

Throughout this project, I gained hands-on experience with:

- The evolution and inner workings of LLMs, from RNNs to Transformer architectures.
- Advanced optimization techniques like prompt engineering and PEFT, including LoRA.
- Practical implementation of RAG to enhance chatbot accuracy and relevance.
- Evaluation methods such as ROUGE metrics to assess model performance.

## 1.6 Conclusion

This project allowed me to harness the power of LLMs to drive innovation and efficiency, as demonstrated by the successful development of an online shopping chatbot. By integrating foundational knowledge with cutting-edge techniques, I not only deepened my technical expertise but also created a practical application with real-world utility. This experience has equipped me with the skills to further explore and contribute to the evolving field of generative AI.
